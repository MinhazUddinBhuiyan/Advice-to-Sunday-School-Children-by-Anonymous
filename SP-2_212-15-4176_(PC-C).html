<h2>ADVICE</h2>
<h3>TO</h3>
<h2>SUNDAY SCHOOL CHILDREN.</h2>

<div class="signature"><span class="smcap">My Dear Children;</span></div>

<p>When our blessed Saviour was upon
earth, little children were brought to him,
and he kindly took them in his arms,
laid his hands upon them, and blessed
them. You have read this pleasing account
in the New Testament, and you
have been taught that this kind Saviour
came down from heaven, and was called
Jesus, because he should save his people
from their sins; you have learned that
God Almighty will punish all wicked
people after death, by sending them into
a dreadful place. Now, consider, children,
that you are all sinners, and though
you are young, be sure, that unless you
repent, and put your trust in Jesus Christ,
God will cast you off for ever, and then
you must be miserable. But Jesus Christ
loves little children who come to him; he
was nailed to the cross, and died to save
them; and he will bless them, while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
live; and when they die, he will take
their souls up to heaven to himself, where
they will be happy with the blessed angels
for ever. Now, if you love him, my
dear children, you will try and do what
he says, and that is what we mean by
your duty. Out of love, therefore, to
you, we give you this little book, which
sets before you some of the good instructions
which are so kindly given you by
your friends in the Sunday School: you
must take care to keep in mind these
things, if you would behave like children
who love their Saviour, and hope to go
to heaven. Read, therefore, this affectionate
admonition, consider it well, and
pray to God for grace, that you may
profit by it.</p>

<p>1. <i>Be early and constant in your attendance
at School.</i> Many naughty children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
come perhaps on one Sunday, and then
are absent for two or three following
ones; this shows that they have no desire
to learn; if they loved our Saviour, they
would not do so. Let not trifles keep you
away; do not mind a little cold or a little
rain, but hasten to school, and if you
are there before your teachers, they will
be pleased with you, and welcome you
with a smile; they will also be encouraged
to take pains with such good children,
and you will go on regularly, and
will not forget your former lessons, and
be obliged to learn them over again, as
foolish and idle children must often do.
Such early attendance will prevent your
class being thrown into confusion; and
your teachers will be delighted to find
that you are always ready for them as
soon as they are ready for you.</p>

<p>2. <i>Be very attentive to instruction.</i> If
instead of minding what is said to you,
you gaze about the school, and look at
the other children, you will still remain
ignorant. When your teachers are explaining
what you have been reading,
listen, and try to understand them. When
you are learning your lesson, keep your
eyes fixed upon your book, and take as
much pains as you can, that you may
repeat it quite perfectly.</p>

<p>3. <i>Be silent in your Class.</i> Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
whisper and talk with those who sit next
you; you have much to learn, and little
time for the purpose; make it not less
by your own carelessness.</p>

<p>4. <i>Be thankful to your Teachers.</i> They
seek your welfare; you hear them pray
for you, and they often do so when you
are not with them. Their hearts' desire
and prayer to God for you, is, that you
may be saved; they would bring you to
Jesus Christ, that you may be delivered
from the wrath of God and endless misery,
through his precious blood shed for
you; that you may be saved from your
sins, by repentance and faith in him;
that you may be taught to pray to God
through him; and that, by his grace,
you may learn and obey his holy commandments,
forsake all sin, do his will
all the days of your life, and when you
die, may inherit the kingdom of heaven.
Whenever, therefore, they admonish,
take heed to their words, fix your eyes
upon them, and your thoughts on what
they say; it is for your good that they
take pains with you; they are seeking
your salvation, and your endless happiness.
How unkind will it be if you do
not love them! How insensible must you
be, if you do not profit by their instruction!
How dreadful will your case be,
if, in the day of judgment, they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
be obliged to bear witness against you,
that they taught you, and laboured to
bring you to salvation, but you would
not! On the contrary, how joyful will it
be for both, if you are placed together
at the right hand of our blessed Saviour,
and hear him say, "Come, ye blessed
children of my Father, receive the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation
of the world."</p>

<p>5. <i>Honour and obey your parents.</i> Remember,
this is God's commandment.
Consider this when you repeat the fifth
commandment; grieve them not by impertinence
and obstinacy; dare not to
answer them with passion or disrespect;
never speak evil of them, nor let others
do so in your hearing; be always gentle,
humble, and dutiful, in your manner;
never frown, or be perverse, or idle,
when they require you to work, but show
that you are willing and industrious; be
a comfort to them, attend on them in
sickness, read your books to them, and
tell them what your teachers say to you;
and strive, as much as in you lies, to be
the staff of their old age, like good Joseph
in the Scripture. So God and they
will bless you; and you will be like our
blessed Saviour, who was subject to his
parents in his childhood, and cared and
provided for his aged mother even while
he hung upon the cross.</p>

<p>6. <i>Love your Brothers and Sisters.</i> Be
kind in your behaviour to each other,
and show your love by actions as well
as words. Do all in your power to make
them happy; let brothers especially behave
with gentleness to their sisters;
they are by nature more weak and defenceless,
and therefore brothers should
treat them with peculiar tenderness. If
your brothers or sisters displease you,
do not speak angrily to them, but be patient,
and forgive them, as you hope our
blessed Saviour will forgive you. If they
rail at you, rail not again; but pray for
them; let them see that you love them
still, and they will be ashamed of themselves,
or, even if they are not, our Saviour
will be pleased with you; for when
he was reviled, he reviled not again. It
is a sad thing when brothers and sisters
quarrel, and dreadful when they strike
each other; but a good and pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
thing when brethren dwell together in
unity and love.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Birds in their little nests agree,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"And 'tis a shameful sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"When children of one family<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Fall out, and chide, and fight."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>7. <i>Reverence the Lord's day.</i> It is appointed
for the worship of God; and all
its hours should be employed in his service.
On this holy day you must give
up your amusements, and have as little
as possible to do with worldly things; on
this day you are taught to read the
word of God, and you go with your
school-fellows to worship him in his
house; there you are to join with the
congregation in prayer and praise, and
to hear the minister of God preach the
gospel, which is to make men wise unto
salvation through faith which is in Christ
Jesus. Let your behaviour be very serious
when you are thus engaged; listen
to every word which the minister speaks;
he is the messenger of God Almighty,
and speaks as if Christ Jesus besought
you, by him, to be reconciled to God. Pray
to God that his word may prove a blessing
to you, and try to understand all
you hear; good children will not only
endeavour to recollect the text and part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the sermon, but will also repeat them
to their parents and teachers. Those
who are idle, careless, or sleepy, in the
house of God, act as if there was no fear
of God before their eyes.</p>

<p>8. <i>Read daily in the Bible.</i> It is the
word of God himself; it points out the
way of salvation by our Saviour Jesus
Christ; if you love him, you will delight
in reading about him in the Bible. God's
word is given for a light unto your feet,
and a lamp unto your path: you know
the use of a lamp in a dark night; such
is the Bible, a light to guide us in this
dark world. Ignorance and wickedness
are the darkness of the world: Jesus is
the light, and the Bible is to instruct you
in the knowledge and love of him. Obey
its commands, avoid what it forbids, follow
its directions; and when you read
it, pray to God to give you understanding,
and a heart to receive its truths, that
by his grace and blessing you may profit
by them.</p>

<p>9. <i>Pray to God constantly.</i> What a
mercy it is that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God will lend a gracious ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To what a child can say!"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>God is your heavenly Father, who
loves you; and though you cannot see
him, he can both see and hear you; and
he <i>will</i> hear you at all times. Confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
all your sins to him, and think upon the
love of our blessed Saviour, who died
for your sins, and pray to God to prosper
you, for his name sake. My dear
children, he is very merciful; and if you
are sorry for your sins, and afraid you
shall be cast into the wicked place for
them, you must tell him your fears, and
he will be gracious to you, and teach
you so to believe on our Lord Jesus
Christ, that your sins will certainly be
all forgiven; and then, oh, how must you
love him! When you are tempted to be
naughty, and disobedient, or ill-tempered,
or idle, pray to him to give you a
new heart and a right spirit; and do not
give over praying for it till you find a
better mind in yourselves; for he will
give you the Holy Spirit, if you ask for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
it. Praise him also for all his mercies
to you, especially for raising up such
good friends to teach you the way of
salvation.</p>

<p>10. <i>Take a cheerful part in the praises
of God.</i> You learn hymns, in order to
sing those praises. What beautiful hymns
they are! I hope you will not merely
please yourselves with the tunes, but study
the meaning of the words, that your
hearts may make melody to the Lord.
How sweetly Moses, and the children of
Israel, sang upon the banks of the Red
Sea, when God had delivered them from
the wicked Egyptians! Exodus, xv.
How sweetly David sang to his harp and
other instruments of music, as you read
in the Book of Psalms! Our blessed Saviour
sang a hymn with his disciples
before he suffered; Matt. xxvi. 30. and
Paul and Silas sang the praises of God
when they were in prison, at dark midnight,
and their feet were made fast in
the stocks. Acts, xvi. 25. Oh, may you,
dear children, sing his praises in the
same blessed spirit, and it will be as
sweet incense before his throne.</p>

<p>11. <i>Abhor Swearing.</i> What! a Sunday
School child swear! Awful thought!
And yet there are some who do! Such
wicked children are taking the broad
road which leads to hell. And what will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 13]<br />[Pg 14]</a></span>
be <i>your</i> feelings, if <i>you</i> are cast into that
dreadful place, after all the pains which
have been taken to lead you to heaven!
Your case will be far more dreadful than
that of others, who are left to perish in
ignorance and sin. Never take the sacred
name of God in vain! Never use it
but with fear and reverence, and when
it is necessary to use it. When careless
children call upon the name of God in
their common conversation, as many do,
exclaiming, Oh, Lord! Oh, God! Lord,
have mercy! and the like, it proves that
they are very wicked, or at least very
thoughtless. Reverence his name, and
tremble at the thought of mentioning it
lightly.</p>

<p>12. <i>Avoid bad company.</i> Remember
the Bible says, "A companion of fools
shall be destroyed." "Therefore, come
out from among them, and be separate,
and I will be a father unto you, and ye
shall be my sons and daughters, saith
the Lord Almighty." Shun all places
of public amusement, particularly taverns
and play-houses. Many people call them
harmless, and their diversions innocent;
but do not believe them; all sorts of
wickedness and folly are practised there&mdash;gluttony,
drunkenness, indecency,
swearing, and sins of almost every kind;
if you go to them, you will soon become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
as bad as the rest of those who frequent
them; do not mind the scorn of those
who may despise you, because you will
not run to the same excess of riot as
they. If they are your relations, or your
acquaintance, endeavour to persuade
them to go to the house of God on the
Lord's day, and on every other day to
keep out of the path of temptation. If
they will not be persuaded to do so, at
least go not with them into any sinful
course. They may endeavour to persuade
you, but withstand their entreaties;
call to mind the words of Solomon,
"My son, if sinners entice thee, consent
thou not!" They may entice, but they
cannot compel you; and as evil communications
corrupt good manners, so, if
you join their company, you will be in
danger of following these wicked examples.
If, my dear children, you hope to
meet our Saviour at the last, and to spend
eternity in heaven with holy angels, and
the spirits of just men made perfect, how
can you bear to be in company with
those wicked people upon earth, who
are, every day, making themselves more
fit for the company of the devil and his
angels in the outer darkness, "where
there shall be weeping, and wailing, and
gnashing of teeth?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>And now I commend you unto God,
and to the word of his grace, which is
able to give you an inheritance among
them that are sanctified. We love you,
we care for you, we pray for you! Oh,
may God turn your hearts by the Holy
Spirit to himself, that you may be his
dear children; and may he bless this little
book to you, and give you grace to
read, to mark, to understand, and to
practise its directions; may you walk in
the path of duty while you live on earth,
and at last join the assembly of his people
before his throne in heaven, share in
their happiness, and unite in their praises,
to all eternity.</p>
